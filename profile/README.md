# ItemFacer

**ItemFacer** is a complete **web-to-mobile solution** designed to **track and manage product facings** using cutting-edge **Augmented Reality (AR)** technologies, **embedded ML models**, and **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to maximize product visibility and optimize in-store layouts.

## 📦 What is ItemFacer?

_ItemFacer_ transforms physical retail environments through AR-powered mobile and web interfaces. It combines:

- 📱 AR-based mobile scanning
- 🧠 Embedded machine learning models
- 🔁 Real-time sync via **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**  
- 📊 Analytics for product-facing performance

---

## 🧠 What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, developed by Anthropic in late 2024, is an open-source, standardized JSON-RPC communication protocol. It enables AI models to seamlessly connect with external data sources and tools—such as your backend systems or product databases—without building custom integrations for each one :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

MCP acts like a universal "USB-C port" for AI-enhanced apps, allowing your embedded models to access context (e.g., inventory databases, shelf-layout metadata) and perform actions via secure, interoperable connections :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **AR Product Scanning**  
  Detect and analyze shelf layouts using your phone’s camera.

- 🧠 **Smart Layout Analytics**  
  On-device model assesses product-facing quality and placement.

- 🔄 **MCP Integration**  
  Embedded models retrieve real-time data and push updates using MCP.

- 🌐 **Web Dashboard**  
  View analytics, performance trends, and reports in real time.

- 🔐 **Secure Multi-user Management**  
  Roles and permissions for field agents, supervisors, and admins.
